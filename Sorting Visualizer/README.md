# Sorting Visualizer

An interactive visualization of popular **Sorting Algorithms**.

## Algorithms

-   **Bubble Sort**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
-   **Selection Sort**: Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and puts it at the beginning.
-   **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## How to Run

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Click **New Array** to generate random data.
3.  Select an algorithm (default: Bubble Sort).
4.  Click **Start Sorting** to watch the animation.
