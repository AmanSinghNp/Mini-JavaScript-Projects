# Manga Motion Reader 📚✨

**Manga Motion Reader** is a Vanilla JS web engine designed to transform the experience of reading digital comics. 

## 🎯 Goal
To bridge the gap between static manga pages and anime by making the reading experience feel **"alive"**. Instead of a passive scroll, every panel has **weight**, **depth**, and **physics-based reactivity**.

## 🌟 Key Features
*   **Physics Engine**: Custom spring-mass simulation makes panels "drag" and "snap" naturally.
*   **Parallax Depth**: Backgrounds and foregrounds move at different speeds, creating a 3D effect.
*   **Snap Scrolling**: The viewport gently magnetizes to center panels for a focused reading experience.
*   **Progress Tracking**: A visual indicator of your journey through the chapter.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Vanilla JavaScript** (No frameworks)
*   **CSS3** (Grid, Flexbox, Transforms)
*   **Custom Physics Loop** (RequestAnimationFrame)
