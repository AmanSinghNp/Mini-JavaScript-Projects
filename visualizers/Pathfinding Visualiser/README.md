# Pathfinding Visualization

An interactive visualization of **Pathfinding Algorithms** on a grid.

## Algorithms
-   **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Guarantees the shortest path.
-   **A* Search**: Uses heuristics to find the shortest path faster.

## Features
-   **Interactive Grid**: Draw walls, move Start and End nodes.
-   **Animation**: Visualizes the search process and the final path.

## How to Run
1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Draw walls by clicking/dragging on the grid.
3.  Select an algorithm and click **Run**.
