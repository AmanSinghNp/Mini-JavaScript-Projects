# Heap Visualization (Min-Heap)

An interactive visualization of a **Min-Heap**.

## Features

-   **Insert**: Add elements and watch them "bubble up" to maintain heap property.
-   **Extract Min**: Remove the root and watch the last element "sink down".
-   **Visuals**: Dual view showing both the Binary Tree structure and the underlying Array storage.

## Logic
-   **Min-Heap Property**: Every parent node is less than or equal to its children.
-   **Structure**: Complete Binary Tree.

## How to Run

1.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2.  Use the inputs to Insert numbers.
3.  Click Extract Min to remove the smallest number.
